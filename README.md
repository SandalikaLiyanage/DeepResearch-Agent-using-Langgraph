This project focuses on building a Planning Agent for Deep Research and Structured Report Generation as an alternative to OpenAIâ€™s Deep Research. The agent follows the popular Planning Agent Design Pattern and automates the process of analyzing a user-defined topic, performing deep web research, and generating a well-structured report.

**1. Report Planning:**

The agent analyzes the user-provided topic and default report template to create a custom plan for the report.
Sections such as Introduction, Key Sections, and Conclusion are defined based on the topic.
A web search tool is used to collect the information required before deciding on the main sections.

**2. Parallel Execution for Research and Writing:**

The agent uses parallel execution to efficiently perform:
Web Research: Queries are generated for each section and executed via the web search tool to retrieve up-to-date information.
Section Writing: The retrieved data is used to write content for each section, with the following process:
The Researcher gathers relevant data from the web.
The Section Writer uses the data to generate structured content for the assigned section.

**3. Formatting Completed Sections:**

Once all sections are written, they are formatted to ensure consistency and adherence to the report structure.

**4. Introduction and Conclusion Writing:**

After the main sections are completed and formatted:
The Introduction and Conclusion are written based on the content of the remaining sections (in parallel)
This process ensures that these sections align with the overall flow and insights of the report.

**5. Final Compilation:**

All completed sections are compiled together to generate the final report.
The final output is a comprehensive and structured report in the style of Wiki docs.
